/// Program output:

///
/// Explain the program output.
///
/// 1      - After creating `Example(1)` we don't binding it anywhere, so the drop is called immediately
/// 4      - In Rust, `_` does not bind values. `_` cannot have ownership of an object. So `Example(4)` is created but not binding to a variable
/// 5      - We assigned ownership of `Some(Example(5))` to _e5, and on the next line _e5 became the owner of `None`. The previous value has no owner, so the value is dropped immediately
/// 6      - Explicitly called drop for e6 variable
/// wrap 8 - Ð¡reated `ExampleWrap(Example(8))` and immediately dropped it, since we do not assign its ownership to the variable
/// 8      - Dropped variable `e` in `<ExampleWrap as Drop>::drop`
/// 0      - drop for `ExampleWrap` field
/// 3      - After exiting `fn main` all variables are dropped in reverse order
/// 2
///
///
/// Explain how Drop works and the order in which they are called.
///
/// In Rust, the drop is called automatically when an object goes out of scope.
/// Or it can be explicitly called via `mem::drop`.
/// Rust automatically calls the destructors of all object's field in order
/// that they declared. Local variables are dropped in reverse order.
